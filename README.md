### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is David and I am gonna try to be uploading here all the things I work on so I can access it later if I need it :). Thats why there is a bit of everything in here. I dont know what else I should write in here since I am basically writing this just to see if my profile gets indexed by google since it was not getting indexed and I found that I have to add this README.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: some things
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: a bit every day :)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: Anything really that interests me
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with: uhh idk
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: anything I guess
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Hack me
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ...
- âš¡ Fun fact: Idk, I will add one some day
